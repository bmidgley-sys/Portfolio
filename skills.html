            <li> Java, my base computer language and by far the one I am most comfortable with. I learned everything from variables and methods, to classes, arrays, arraylists, multidimensional arrays, polymorphism, and much more. </li>
            <li> Android Studio, which also uses Java. This however allows you to more easily build front end UI, and integrate it with the backend code to create applications and games much easier, but at the same time, the process could be a pain. </li>
            <li> Python, not too difficult, but considering the only thing I really used it for was Ai linear regression training, which in my opinion was very confusing, as well as basic scripting. </li>
            <li> HTML, a rather new computer language, not too difficult but still figuring a lot of it out, there are are still plenty of times my mind shorts circuits trying to remember what to do next. </li>
            <li> CSS, another computer language, which I believe is actually Python though I can't remember. Its used to style the websites created using HTML to make the webpages look much neater. </li>
            <li> JavaScript, not the same as Java, if anything, I would say its closer to Python than to Java. Anyway, this is the backend code to the HTML websites. This is what allows buttons and various other features on the webpages to do their tasks. Of course, JavaScript can be used for a lot more than that, but so far that is all I have used it for. </li>
            <li> Server Admin, a bunch of control settings used to set up servers, computers, networks, users, and much more in order to delegate or restrict, etc. Essentially this is the rule maker portion of server setup. </li>
            <li> Scripting, can be used to help complete tasks for you in a simpler way, though creating the scripting, depending on the taks you want accompished, can also prove to be quite challenging. </li>
            <li> Etc. </li>
        </ol>
