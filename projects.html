                <li> Web Dev, this Portfolio, in a way is a project to be honest, though its a very short one. Though this webpage can be built upon as time goes on, I can incorporate my resume, keep improving on the style, and much more. THis webpage could become quite useful in the future depending on the context of what it is being used for. Likely a job interview or introduction should I become a leader of a team and want a way to show my team more about me in an interactive and fun way. Overall, I see the skills developed over the duration of this class as well as this very webpage being quite useful in my arsenal sometime down the line. </li>

                <li> Java, plenty of projects were done though it is hard to go into detail at this time, one of them, I continue to work on to this day. I created an app through the console where the user gets to create a player and go on a task to clear a tower where monsters grow exponenitally faster the higher you go. You can even control how many floors are generated, though, right now you can only do so through the code itself and not the console. I plan to integrate a proper UI eventually though. </li>

            <div class="card">
                <li> Stats, week by week projects where we had to go out and collect data amongst other students, people we know etc. We had to be careful how we collected data in order to avoid bias. Next was a series of different kinds of tests used to come to different conclusions about the data collected. </li>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <li> Interpersonal Communications, a board game project where my group went and made a board game over the cours eof a month, starting from scrath, coming up with our own rules and such. We also just finished a collaborative art project where my group made a llama sculpture. </li>
