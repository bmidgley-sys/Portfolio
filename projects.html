            <li> Web Dev, this Portfolio, in a way is a project to be honest, though its a very short one. </li>
            <li> Java, plenty of projects were done though it is hard to go into detail at this time, one of them, I continue to work on to this day. I created an app through the ocnsole where the user gets to create a player and go on a task to clear a tower where monsters gro exponenitally faster the higher you go. You can even control how many floors are generated though right now you can only do so through the code itself and not the console. I plan to integrate a proper UI eventually though. </li>
            <li> Stats, week by week projects where we had to go out and collect data amongst other students, people we know etc. We had to be careful how we collected data in order to avoid bias. Next was a series of different kinds of tests used to come to different conclusions about the data collected. </li>
            <li> Interpersonal Communications, a board game project where my group went and made a board game over the cours eof a month, starting from scrath, coming up with our own rules and such. We also just finished a collaborative art project where my group made a llama sculpture. </li>
            <li> Etc. </li>
        </ol>
