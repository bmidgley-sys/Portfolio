        <H2> About Me </H2>
        <p> Well, my Name is Bradley Midgley, I am 20 years old. I have 4 siblings, 2 brothers and 2 sisters, with me being the second oldest right behind my older brother who is now 22. I got married back near the end of March and am quite happy overall. I attended Salt Lake Community College foir Physics when I was still in highschool as it was a prerequisite for my attemot at joing the NSA. However, that inital plan didn't work out, perhaps for the better. Thinking back on it now, I doubt I would be happy taking that route in my life. Shortly after graduation from highschool I moved to USU and attended for a semester there. Though everything was priority based with seniors getting first pick, classes had limited students and with a much larger student body, getting into the classes you wanted were a lot harder than necessary. The coding class I did take during that semester was extremely low level and made me have doubts about the level of education I would be getting at that school. So, I moved to Neumont. Right now I am working towards my Information Science degree to start me on my official path to becoming an Ethical Hacker and am set to graduate in 2027. </p>
